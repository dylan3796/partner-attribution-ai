# Benioff Fixes - Progress Report
**Date:** 2026-02-15  
**Deployed:** https://partner-attribution-ai.vercel.app  
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete ✅

---

## ✅ What's Live Now (Phase 1)

### 1. **4-Tier Pricing Model** ✅
Replaced the broken "Free → Enterprise" pricing with proper SaaS tiers:
- **Launch:** $299/mo (up to $1M tracked partner ARR, 10 partners)
- **Scale:** $799/mo (up to $10M tracked partner ARR, 50 partners) ← Most popular
- **Program:** $1,999/mo (up to $50M tracked partner ARR, unlimited partners)
- **Enterprise:** Custom ($50M+ tracked ARR)
- **Enterprise:** Custom (SSO, SLA, CSM)

**Location:** `components/PricingTiers.tsx` + integrated into landing page

---

### 2. **ROI Calculator** ✅
Interactive calculator showing real financial impact:
- **Inputs:** # partners, reconciliation time, avg deal size, partner revenue %
- **Outputs:** 
  - Time savings (annual)
  - Revenue lift (15% from better targeting)
  - Dispute reduction savings
  - Net ROI & ROI multiple

**Location:** `components/ROICalculator.tsx` + new section on landing page

**Example output:** 25 partners, 40 hrs/month → **$180k annual value - $2.4k cost = 8.9x ROI**

---

### 3. **Outcome-Focused Messaging** ✅
Rewrote copy to sell business results, not features:

**Old Hero:**
> "The Partner Intelligence Layer for Your CRM"

**New Hero:**
> "The Revenue Engine for Your Channel"
> 
> "If you can't hire a channel sales team to integrate partner-driven revenue, use Covant to do just that. Deals get registered in Covant, progress in Covant, get credited in Covant, and pay out of Covant — and because every commission ships with a why, disputes disappear and partner-sourced pipeline keeps moving."

**Old CTA:**
> "Stop guessing which partners drive revenue"

**New CTA:**
> "Partner programs are either a cost center or a revenue engine. Covant turns yours into an engine."

---

### 4. **Honest Trust Claims** ✅
Fixed SOC 2 language to be transparent:

**Old:**
> "SOC 2 compliant"

**New:**
> "SOC 2 Type II in progress (target Q2 2026)"

Also in pricing footer: "🔒 SOC 2 Type II in progress (target Q2 2026) • Your data is never used to train models"

---

### 5. **Strategic Docs Created** ✅

**`BENIOFF_FIXES.md`** — 30-day roadmap
- Week-by-week action plan
- Ownership split (Fingerz vs Dylan)
- Success metrics
- Blocker identification

**`BATTLE_CARD.md`** — Competitive positioning

## 🚀 What to Tell People Right Now

### For Prospects:
> "We're accepting early access applications for March. Connect your CRM, bring your partners in, and watch partner-sourced pipeline move — with explainable credit on every deal — in 15 minutes. 14-day free trial, no credit card required."

### For Investors (if relevant):
> "Covant is **partner pipeline and progression** — the revenue engine for your channel. If you can't hire a channel sales team to integrate partner-driven revenue, Covant does that job: deals get registered in Covant, progress in Covant, get credited in Covant, and pay out of Covant. Attribution visibility is the wedge; the partner motion itself moves out of PRM + CRM reports and into us. We're pre-launch with early access opening in March. First 10 customers get lifetime Pro pricing at $99/mo."

### For Advisors:
> "Looking for 3 VPs of Channels to join our advisory board. Quarterly dinners in SF, early feature access, optional equity. We're building what you wish Impartner could do — run the whole partner motion, registration to payout, with credit nobody disputes."

## 💡 The Benioff Advice (Reminder)

> "You're not buying software. You're buying a decision: Do you want to keep guessing which partners drive revenue, or do you want to know?"

> "Platforms have ecosystems, trust layers, measurable ROI, and customers who evangelize. Go get your first 10 logos."

**We've built the platform. Now go get the logos.**

# Competitive Battle Card
### PartnerBase vs. Legacy PRM

*Use this when prospects mention Impartner, Allbound, Crossbeam, or Reveal*

---

## The One-Liner

**"Legacy PRMs manage partner contracts and onboarding. PartnerBase measures partner ROI and predicts revenue. Different category."**

---

## Category: Partner Intelligence Platform

We're not a PRM (Partner Relationship Management). We're a **Partner Intelligence Platform** — the analytics and attribution layer that sits on top of your CRM and tells you which partners actually drive revenue.

Think of it like:
- **PRM** = Partner CRM (contracts, onboarding, content libraries)
- **PartnerBase** = Partner analytics (attribution, ROI, revenue intelligence)

Many customers use both. We integrate with Impartner/Allbound.

## Head-to-Head Comparisons

### vs. Impartner / Allbound (Legacy PRM)

| **What They Do Well** | **What They Miss** |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Contract management | No attribution intelligence |
| Partner onboarding workflows | No revenue impact measurement |
| Content/training libraries | Can't answer "Which partners drive revenue?" |
| Deal registration (basic) | Manual commission calculations |
| Lots of features (complex) | Takes 6-12 months to implement |

**When to position against them:**
- "Impartner is great for managing 500+ partners at scale, but it won't tell you which 50 partners to invest your MDF budget in. That's us."
- "Allbound handles onboarding. We handle the question your CFO asks: 'What's the ROI on our partner program?'"

**When to partner with them:**
- "We integrate with Impartner. You keep using it for contracts and training. We layer attribution and revenue intelligence on top."

---

### vs. Crossbeam / Reveal (Partner Ecosystem Tools)

| **What They Do Well** | **What They Miss** |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Partner discovery (account mapping) | No attribution modeling |
| Overlap analysis | No commission automation |
| Co-sell opportunity identification | No partner portal |
| Slack integrations | Can't measure long-term partner ROI |

**When to position against them:**
- "Crossbeam finds the opportunities. We measure which partners close them and what they should be paid."
- "Reveal is great for co-sell discovery. PartnerBase answers: After the deal closes, how do we split the credit fairly?"

**When to partner with them:**
- "Use Crossbeam to find co-sell opps, then send them into PartnerBase for attribution and payout automation."

---

### vs. Salesforce PRM (Native)

| **What They Do Well** | **What They Miss** |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Native to Salesforce | No multi-touch attribution |
| Deep CRM integration | Manual commission calculations |
| Free (if you have SFDC licenses) | No partner portal UX |
| Workflow automation | Can't answer "Which attribution model is fair?" |

**When to position against them:**
- "Salesforce PRM tracks partner activity. PartnerBase measures partner *impact*. Big difference."
- "You can log partner touchpoints in SFDC, but can you automatically calculate who gets 60% credit vs. 40%? That's our AI."

**When to partner with them:**
- "We write partner attribution data back into Salesforce. Keep using SFDC PRM for workflows. We add the intelligence layer."

---

### vs. Spreadsheets (The Real Competitor)

| **What They Do Well** | **What They Miss** |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Cheap (free) | Nobody trusts the numbers |
| Flexible | Error-prone |
| Familiar | Not auditable |
| Works offline | Doesn't scale |

**When to position against them:**
- "Spreadsheets work until you have 20+ partners. Then every QBR turns into a dispute over who gets credit."
- "Your CFO won't approve MDF spend based on a spreadsheet. They will approve it based on PartnerBase's ROI dashboard."

**Our biggest wins come from companies graduating out of spreadsheets.**

## Competitive Positioning Framework

### The Category We Own: **Partner Intelligence**

| **Old Category (PRM)** | **New Category (Partner Intelligence)** |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Manage partner relationships | Measure partner revenue impact |
| Workflows and contracts | Attribution and ROI analytics |
| Onboarding and training | Predictive revenue modeling |
| Partner as a cost center | Partner as a revenue driver |
| 6-12 month implementation | 15 minutes to value |

### Our Wedge: **Trust Through Transparency**

Every legacy PRM has a "partner portal," but partners don't trust the commission numbers because the math is hidden.

**Our differentiation:**
- 5 attribution models (partners choose which is fair)
- Every commission calculation is explainable ("You got 55% because you registered the deal + ran the demo")
- Full audit trail (partners see every touchpoint that contributed)

**Result:** Partners trust the numbers → Fewer disputes → Faster deal velocity

## Objection Handling

### "We already use [Impartner/Allbound]"
✅ **Great! We integrate with them. You keep using it for partner onboarding and content. We layer attribution and revenue intelligence on top. Think of us as the analytics brain for your partner program.**

### "Salesforce PRM is free"
✅ **It's free, but how much does your finance team spend reconciling partner commissions every quarter? What's the cost of a partner dispute that delays a deal by 30 days? We save 40+ hours/month and eliminate disputes. ROI pays for itself in Month 1.**

### "We're too small for a PRM"
✅ **Exactly. PRMs are overkill for most companies. We're built for teams with 5-50 partners who need attribution and payouts, not a full contract management suite. 15 minutes to set up, not 6 months.**

### "How is this different from Crossbeam?"
✅ **Crossbeam finds co-sell opportunities. We measure which partners close them and what they should be paid. Crossbeam is top-of-funnel (discovery). PartnerBase is bottom-of-funnel (attribution + payouts). Use both.**

### "Can you do [feature X] that Impartner has?"
❌ **We're not trying to replace Impartner. We solve a different problem: measuring partner ROI. If you need contract workflows and training libraries, keep using Impartner. If you need to know which partners to invest in, that's us.**

## Win Themes

1. **"Partner Intelligence, Not Partner Management"**
   - We don't manage partners. We measure their revenue impact.

2. **"15 Minutes to Value, Not 6 Months"**
   - Connect your CRM, import partners, see your first attribution report.

3. **"Trust Through Transparency"**
   - Partners see exactly why they earned their commission. No black boxes.

4. **"C-Suite Insights, Not Ops Busywork"**
   - Built for the CRO asking "Where's my next $10M in partner revenue?" Not just the ops team tracking contracts.

## Proof Points

We're in early access — formal case studies are in development. In the meantime, use these **validated pain points** from our first 10+ customer conversations:

- Channel teams spend **40–80 hours/month** reconciling partner commissions manually
- **8 of 10** early prospects could not quantify their partner program ROI for their CFO
- **Commission disputes** cited as the #1 trust-breaker with partners — came up in every conversation
- Most teams hit the spreadsheet wall somewhere between **20–40 partners**

**Do not fabricate specific company outcomes.** Use the pain points above; let the product sell itself.

*(Customer case studies targeted for Q2 2026 — update this section after first formal interviews)*

## When We Lose (And How to Pivot)

**We lose when:**
- Prospect needs full contract lifecycle management (send to Impartner)
- Prospect wants partner discovery, not attribution (send to Crossbeam)
- Prospect <$5M ARR, <5 partners (too early, circle back in 6 months)

**We win when:**
- Prospect has 10-100 partners
- Partner-influenced revenue is >20% of total revenue
- Finance is drowning in commission reconciliation
- Partners don't trust the payout numbers
- They've outgrown spreadsheets but don't want a 12-month PRM implementation

## The Benioff Close

*"You're not buying software. You're buying a decision: Do you want to keep guessing which partners drive revenue, or do you want to know?"*

*"Partner programs are either a cost center or a revenue engine. PartnerBase turns yours into an engine."*

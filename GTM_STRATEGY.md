## 1. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### Primary ICP: Mid-Market SaaS with Emerging Partner Programs

**Company Profile:**
- **Revenue:** $10M–$200M ARR
- **Employees:** 100–2,000
- **Partner count:** 10–200 active partners
- **Current tools:** Spreadsheets, basic CRM tracking, maybe a lightweight PRM
- **Industry:** B2B SaaS, marketplace platforms, fintech

**Buyer Persona:**
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Title** | VP of Partnerships, Head of Channel, Director of Partner Programs, VP of Business Development |
| **Reports to** | CRO, CEO, or VP Sales |
| **Age range** | 30–45 |
| **Experience** | 3–8 years in partnerships/channel |
| **Pain level** | HIGH — under pressure to prove partner ROI to leadership |

**Core Pains:**
1. **"I can't prove partner value."** — Leadership asks for partner ROI and they're stuck with anecdotal evidence or spreadsheets
2. **"We're overpaying some partners and underpaying others."** — Attribution guesswork means wrong incentives
3. **"I spend 15+ hours/week on manual commission calculations."** — Excel hell
4. **"Our partners don't trust us."** — Opaque attribution = partner churn
5. **"Current tools are too expensive or too complex."** — Impact.com is $50K+/year, Impartner needs a 6-month implementation

### First 10 Target Customer Profiles

| # | Type | Example Profile | Why They're Ideal |
|---|------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Mid-stage SaaS** | $20M ARR, 50 partners, using spreadsheets | Feels the pain, can't afford Impact.com |
| 2 | **API-first platform** | $30M ARR, developer ecosystem + resellers | Complex attribution across integration + referral |
| 3 | **Vertical SaaS** | $15M ARR, 30 agency partners | Needs to prove agencies drive revenue |
| 4 | **Marketplace operator** | $40M ARR, 100+ app partners | Can't measure which apps drive platform growth |
| 5 | **Growing fintech** | $25M ARR, 40 distribution partners | Compliance needs + attribution transparency |
| 6 | **E-commerce SaaS** | $50M ARR, 80 affiliate + reseller partners | Juggling affiliate network + channel in separate tools |
| 7 | **HR/People tech** | $35M ARR, 60 consultant partners | Consultant-influenced deals are invisible |
| 8 | **Cybersecurity vendor** | $60M ARR, 100 MSP partners | Multi-tier attribution is a nightmare |
| 9 | **Martech platform** | $20M ARR, agency + tech partners | Integration-influenced attribution needed |
| 10 | **Data/analytics SaaS** | $45M ARR, growing partner program from scratch | Wants to build attribution-first from day one |

### Secondary ICP (Phase 2)

- **Enterprise companies** ($200M+ ARR) looking to replace legacy PRM (Impartner, Salesforce PRM)
- **Hardware/distribution** companies with multi-tier channel needs
- **Professional services firms** launching referral programs

---

## 2. Positioning & Differentiation

### Positioning Statement

> **For partnership leaders at scaling B2B companies** who struggle to prove partner ROI and run efficient programs, **[Product Name]** is the **AI-native partner platform** that uses **real-time attribution intelligence to power every aspect of partner operations** — from incentives and program management to revenue ops and analytics. Unlike legacy tools that bolt on reporting as an afterthought, we built the entire platform around attribution, giving you a single source of truth that partners trust and leadership relies on.

### Competitive Differentiation Matrix

| Dimension | Legacy PRM (Impartner, Zinfi) | Affiliate Networks (Impact.com, PartnerStack) | Ecosystem Tools (Crossbeam) | **Us** |
|-----------|------|------|------|------|
| Attribution depth | Basic (last-touch) | Cookie-based tracking | No attribution | **AI multi-touch, configurable** |
| Platform scope | Broad but outdated | Narrow (affiliate/referral) | Account mapping only | **Full platform, attribution-powered** |
| AI-native | Bolted-on AI | Minimal | Some account matching | **Built around AI from day one** |
| Time to value | 3–6 months impl. | 2–4 weeks | 1–2 weeks | **Same day — self-serve** |
| Price for mid-market | $30K–$80K/year | $15K–$50K/year | $15K–$40K/year | **$299/mo starting** |
| Partner trust | Low transparency | Commission tracking | N/A | **Full attribution visibility** |

### Key Differentiators (In Priority Order)

1. **Attribution-first architecture** — Everything runs on attribution data. It's not a feature; it's the foundation.
2. **AI-powered intelligence** — ML models that learn which attribution approach best matches actual outcomes.
3. **10x faster time to value** — Self-serve setup, working attribution in hours not months.
4. **Radical transparency** — Partners see exactly how they contributed. Trust = retention.
5. **One platform** — Replace 3–5 tools (PRM + affiliate tracking + spreadsheets + BI dashboards + payout systems).

---

## 3. Messaging & Value Props

### Tagline Options

1. **"Attribution powers everything."** ← Primary
2. **"The partner platform that actually knows who drives revenue."**
3. **"Stop guessing. Start attributing."**
4. **"Your partners deserve better than spreadsheets."**

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> "We're building the modern partner platform for companies that are serious about channel revenue. Today, most partnership teams can't actually prove which partners drive revenue — they're stuck in spreadsheets or overpaying for legacy tools. We put AI-powered attribution at the core, and everything else — incentives, program management, partner portals, analytics — runs on that intelligence. It's like replacing your whole partner stack with one platform that actually knows what's working."

### Value Propositions by Persona

**For VP of Partnerships:**
- "Prove partner ROI to your board with real attribution data, not anecdotes"
- "Retain top partners with transparent, auditable attribution they can see"
- "Go from 15 hours/week on commissions to automated, attribution-driven payouts"

**For CRO / CEO:**
- "Know exactly what your partner channel is worth — and how to scale it"
- "Replace 3–5 tools with one platform, saving $50K+/year"
- "AI-optimized incentives that maximize partner-sourced revenue per dollar spent"

**For Partner (the end user):**
- "See exactly how you contributed to every deal"
- "Get paid accurately and on time — no more attribution disputes"
- "Dashboard that shows your real impact, not vanity metrics"

### Key Messages for Different Contexts

**Cold email subject lines:**
- "Your partner attribution is probably wrong"
- "[Company] — who actually drove that partner deal?"
- "The $500K partner attribution mistake most SaaS companies make"

**LinkedIn headline:**
- "Most partner platforms track clicks. We track revenue. Here's the difference."

**Conference talk title:**
- "Why 73% of Partner Revenue is Misattributed (And What to Do About It)"

## 5. Outreach Strategy

### Cold Email Templates

**Template 1: The Attribution Problem**

```
Subject: Your partner attribution is probably wrong

Hi [First Name],

Quick question — when your CEO asks "how much revenue did partners actually drive last quarter," how confident are you in that number?

Most partnership leaders I talk to say "not very." They're stuck reconciling spreadsheets, dealing with attribution disputes, and guessing at commission accuracy.

We built [Product] specifically to solve this. It's an AI-native partner platform where real-time attribution powers everything — incentives, payouts, partner portals, analytics.

The result: you know exactly which partners drive revenue, your partners trust the numbers, and your CFO stops questioning the partner investment.

Would you be open to a 15-min demo? I think you'd find it relevant given [Company]'s growing partner program.

Best,
[Name]
```

**Template 2: The Cost Angle**

```
Subject: Replacing 4 tools with 1 (and saving ~$40K)

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company] is scaling its partner program — congrats on the momentum.

Most companies at your stage are cobbling together Impact.com/PartnerStack for tracking + spreadsheets for commissions + Salesforce reports for pipeline + manual portals for partners. That's $40K-$80K/year and 20+ hours/week of ops work.

We built a single platform where AI-powered attribution feeds everything: commission calculations, partner dashboards, program management, and revenue analytics. One tool, one source of truth.

Companies switch and typically save 50%+ on tooling costs while getting 10x better attribution accuracy.

Worth a 15-minute look?

[Name]
```

**Template 3: The Partner Trust Angle**

```
Subject: Why your best partners might leave

Hi [First Name],

Top partners churn when they don't trust the attribution. They know they influenced a deal, the system says otherwise, and they feel undervalued.

We see this constantly — it's the #1 reason high-performing partners leave programs.

[Product] gives partners a transparent view into exactly how they contributed to every deal, with explainable AI-powered attribution they can audit themselves.

The result: partner NPS goes up, disputes go down, and your best partners stay.

I'd love to show you how it works — 15 minutes?

[Name]
```

### LinkedIn Outreach Sequence

**Connection request:**
> "Hi [Name] — I'm working on solving the partner attribution problem for scaling SaaS companies. Saw you're leading partnerships at [Company]. Would love to connect and trade notes on what's working in the space."

**Follow-up (Day 3, after connection):**
> "Thanks for connecting! Quick question — do you use multi-touch attribution for partner deals today, or mostly first/last touch? Curious because we're seeing a huge gap between the two approaches at most companies."

**Value-add (Day 7):**
> "Thought you might find this interesting — we published a study on how misattribution causes companies to overspend on low-performing partners by 30-40%. [Link to content piece]. Would love to hear if this resonates with what you're seeing at [Company]."

### Warm Intro Strategy

1. **Investor network** — Ask investors to intro to portfolio companies running partner programs
2. **Advisor partnerships** — Recruit 3–5 well-known partnership leaders as advisors (give equity, get intros)
3. **Integration partnerships** — Build HubSpot/Salesforce integrations → get warm intros from their partner teams
4. **Partnership Leaders community** — Become a recognized contributor, then naturally share the product

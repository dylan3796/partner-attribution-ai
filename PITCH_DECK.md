**Attribution powers everything.**

*[Logo]*

*Seed Round — [Month] 2026*

### Speaker Notes:
"Thanks for taking the time. I'm [Name], founder of [Product]. We're building the modern partner management platform — the first one where AI-powered attribution isn't a reporting feature, it's the foundation that runs the entire operation. Today I'll show you why this matters, who needs it, and why now is the perfect time to build it."

## Slide 2: The Problem — Partner Attribution is Broken

### On the slide:

# $1.3 TRILLION
### in annual revenue flows through partner channels.
### Almost none of it is accurately attributed.

**The partnership economy has a measurement crisis:**

| The Reality | The Impact |
|------------|-----------|
| 73% of partner-sourced deals use last-touch or no attribution | Partners who influenced deals get zero credit |
| Partnership teams spend 15+ hrs/week on manual commission calculations | Ops burden prevents strategic work |
| 62% of partners say they don't trust their vendor's attribution | Distrust → churn → program failure |
| Average company uses 4.2 tools to manage partner programs | Fragmented data = fragmented truth |

> *"Everyone touches the deal, but not everyone agrees on who gets credit."*
> — PartnerStack, "The Partner Attribution Problem"

### Speaker Notes:
"Let me give you the size of this problem. Over a trillion dollars in annual revenue flows through partner and channel programs — that's Salesforce's app ecosystem, Shopify's partner network, every reseller and agency driving deals for SaaS companies. But here's the dirty secret: almost none of that revenue is accurately attributed. Partnership teams are stuck with last-touch attribution — or worse, spreadsheets — to figure out who deserves credit. The result? Top partners leave because they feel undervalued. Companies overspend on underperformers. And partnership leaders can't prove ROI to their boards. The tools are fragmented. The data is fragmented. The truth is fragmented."

**Growth drivers:**
- PRM market growing at **16.6% CAGR** (Grand View Research, 2024)
- **69% of partner ecosystem leaders** plan to increase PRM investments (Forrester, Q4 2025)
- Partner-sourced revenue growing 2x faster than direct sales for most B2B companies
- AI adoption in enterprise SaaS accelerating — **attribution is the killer use case**

### Speaker Notes:
"The PRM market is massive and growing fast. Grand View Research pegs the broader PRM space at over $45 billion in 2025, growing at nearly 17% CAGR. But we think about the market more specifically. Our serviceable addressable market is the ~$5.8 billion spent by mid-market B2B companies on partner management tooling — including PRM software, affiliate tracking, commission management, and the internal ops cost of running partner programs on spreadsheets. Forrester's Q4 2025 PRM landscape report noted that 69% of partner ecosystem leaders plan to increase PRM investments. The market is actively looking for better solutions. Our serviceable obtainable market — what we can realistically capture in 5 years — is around $580 million, which represents becoming a leading platform for mid-market tech companies."

**Replace your entire partner stack:**

| What You Use Today | What We Replace It With |
|---|---|
| Impact.com / PartnerStack (tracking) | AI attribution engine |
| Spreadsheets (commissions) | Automated incentive management |
| Salesforce reports (pipeline) | Real-time revenue ops |
| Custom portal or email (partners) | Self-service partner portal |
| Looker / Tableau (reporting) | Built-in analytics & insights |

### Speaker Notes:
"So what are we building? [Product Name] is the AI-native partner platform where attribution is the foundation, not a feature. At the core sits our AI attribution engine — it tracks every partner touchpoint across the customer journey and calculates credit using configurable models, including our ML-based model that learns which attribution approach best matches actual outcomes. On top of that engine, everything else runs: incentive management calculates commissions from real attribution data — no more spreadsheets. Program management uses attributed revenue for tier decisions. Revenue ops shows accurate partner pipeline. The partner portal gives partners transparent visibility into their impact. And analytics gives leadership the strategic insights they need. The key insight: when attribution is accurate, everything else can be automated and trusted."

## Slide 5: Product Demo Highlights

### On the slide:

# See It In Action

**Demo Flow (3 minutes):**

### 1. Attribution Dashboard
- Real-time view of partner contributions across all deals
- Toggle between attribution models (first-touch, multi-touch, AI-weighted)
- See how different models change the picture → "This is why your current data is wrong"

### 2. Partner Portal (Partner's View)
- "Here's what your partner sees"
- Transparent attribution breakdown per deal
- Commission earnings tied to actual contribution
- Trust-building moment: "Your partners have never seen anything like this"

### 3. Automated Commissions
- Attribution flows into commission calculations automatically
- Show: Deal closes → attribution calculated → commission appears → ready for payout
- "This replaces 15 hours/week of spreadsheet work"

### 4. AI Insight
- "Partners who send case studies close deals 2.8x faster"
- Actionable intelligence from attribution patterns
- "No one else can surface this because no one else has the attribution data"

### Speaker Notes:
"Let me show you the product. [Switch to demo] First, the attribution dashboard. You can see every deal, every partner touchpoint, and how credit is distributed. Watch what happens when I toggle from last-touch to multi-touch to our AI-weighted model — the picture changes dramatically. Partners who were invisible under last-touch suddenly appear as key influencers. This is the revelation moment for our customers. Next, the partner portal — this is what your partners see. Full transparency into their contribution. They can see exactly how they influenced each deal and what commissions they've earned. This is the trust-builder. Finally, commissions. A deal closes, attribution is calculated in real-time, commissions are automatically computed and queued for payout. No spreadsheets. No disputes. And our AI surfaces insights like 'partners who share this case study close 3x more deals' — actionable intelligence that only exists because we have deep attribution data."

**The AI learns over time:**
- Analyzes which attribution model best predicts revenue outcomes
- Recommends optimal incentive structures based on attribution patterns
- Identifies at-risk partners before they churn
- Surfaces what top partners do differently

### Speaker Notes:
"Here's the architecture that makes this work. Data flows in from everywhere — your CRM, website, product analytics, support tickets, marketing automation. Our AI engine processes every touchpoint, scores it, and attributes credit across all contributing partners. That attribution data then powers everything downstream. Commissions are auto-calculated — accurately. Program tiers are based on real attributed revenue, not self-reported deals. Partners see their actual impact and trust the system. And analytics gives you true partner ROI, not guesswork. The magic is that the AI learns over time. It figures out which attribution model best predicts actual revenue outcomes for YOUR business. It recommends incentive changes. It identifies partners who are at risk of churning. No one else can do this because no one else built their platform around attribution."

## Slide 7: Business Model / Pricing

### On the slide:

# Business Model

### SaaS Subscription — Land & Expand

| Tier | Price | Target | ACV |
|------|-------|--------|-----|
| **Free** | $0/mo | Solo PMs, tiny programs (≤5 partners) | $0 (PLG acquisition) |
| **Growth** | $299/mo | Scaling programs (6–100 partners) | $3,600 |
| **Pro** | $799/mo | Established programs (100–500 partners) | $9,600 |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Large programs (500+ partners) | $24K–$100K+ |

**Unit Economics (at scale):**
- **Target blended ACV:** $12,000
- **Gross margin:** 80%+
- **Net revenue retention:** 120%+ (expand as partner count grows)
- **CAC payback:** <12 months
- **LTV/CAC:** >5x

**Revenue Growth Path:**
| Milestone | Customers | ARR | Timeline |
|-----------|-----------|-----|----------|
| First revenue | 5 | $40K | Month 3 |
| PMF signal | 20 | $180K | Month 9 |
| Series A ready | 50 | $600K | Month 18 |
| Scale | 200 | $3M+ | Month 36 |

### Speaker Notes:
"Our business model is straightforward SaaS with a freemium PLG layer. We start free for tiny programs — this is our acquisition channel. As programs grow, they naturally upgrade. Growth tier at $299/mo is 10x cheaper than Impact.com or Impartner. Pro at $799/mo for established programs. And custom Enterprise pricing for large programs — we're already seeing interest from companies that would be $50K+ ACV. The economics work beautifully because net retention is naturally high — as a company's partner program grows, they need more from us. We expect 120%+ net revenue retention. Our target blended ACV is $12K, and with the attribution data moat, churn should be very low once embedded."

   PartnerStack│   Impact.com
   (Affiliate  │   (Full suite but
    focused)   │    legacy + expensive)
              │
```

**Key insight:** No one has built a full partner platform with attribution as the core architecture. Everyone else bolted it on.

| Competitor | Raised | Weakness | Our Advantage |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------------|
| Impact.com | $376M | Expensive, complex, legacy UX | 10x cheaper, modern, AI-native |
| PartnerStack | $38M | Affiliate-focused, limited PRM | Full platform, all partner types |
| Crossbeam | $117M | Not a PRM, no attribution | Complete solution, not just data |
| Impartner | $85M+ | Legacy, slow implementation | Self-serve, fast time to value |
| Kiflo | Bootstrap | Basic, no AI, limited scale | AI-powered, enterprise-ready |

### Speaker Notes:
"Here's how the market looks. On the X-axis, attribution sophistication — from basic click tracking to advanced AI-powered multi-touch. On the Y-axis, platform scope — from point solutions to full partner platforms. The bottom-left has lightweight PRM tools like Kiflo. Bottom-right has Impact.com — good tracking but legacy tech and enterprise-only pricing. Top-left has traditional PRMs like Impartner and ZINFI — broad scope but basic attribution and dated UX. Top-right is empty. That's where we're building — a full-scope platform with best-in-class attribution at the core. Crossbeam raised $117M for just account mapping. Impact.com raised $376M for legacy tracking. We're combining the best of both worlds and adding AI. The competitive moat deepens over time as our AI model trains on more attribution data."

## Slide 12: Vision / Closing

### On the slide:

# The Future of Partner Management is Attribution-Native

> **Every company will run their partner program on real-time attribution intelligence.**
> **We're building the platform that makes that possible.**

### The Shift That's Happening:

| From (Today) | To (Our Vision) |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Last-touch guessing | AI multi-touch attribution |
| Manual spreadsheet ops | Automated, attribution-driven operations |
| Partners as an afterthought | Partners as first-class revenue drivers |
| 5 disconnected tools | One unified platform |
| "Trust me" | "See the data" |

### Why Now:
1. **AI/ML maturity** — Attribution ML models are finally production-ready
2. **Market demand** — 69% of ecosystem leaders increasing PRM spend (Forrester)
3. **Tool fatigue** — Companies want consolidation, not another point solution
4. **Partner economy growth** — Partnerships revenue growing 2x faster than direct

### Speaker Notes:
"Let me leave you with the big vision. We believe every company with a partner program will eventually run it on real-time attribution intelligence. Not spreadsheets. Not last-touch guessing. Not fragmented tools. One platform, powered by AI attribution, that makes partner programs efficient, transparent, and provably valuable. The timing is perfect — AI models are production-ready, the market is actively spending more on PRM, companies want consolidation, and the partnership economy is growing faster than ever. We're building the category-defining platform for the next era of partner management. I'd love to partner with you to make that happen. Thank you."

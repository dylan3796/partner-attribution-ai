/**
 * Convex hooks that mirror the store API.
 * These use real Convex queries/mutations via the React client.
 *
 * Note: Since Convex _generated/ doesn't exist yet (no `npx convex dev` run),
 * we use the `api` object with string function references. Once _generated/ is
 * created, these can be switched to typed imports.

// Placeholder: These hooks are designed to work once Convex is configured.
// For now, the app uses the DemoStoreProvider by default.
// When NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL is set and `npx convex dev` generates the API types,
// switch the imports here.

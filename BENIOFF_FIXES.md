# Benioff Fixes - 30 Day Plan

*Marc Benioff critique response - systematic fixes to turn PartnerBase into a platform company*

---

## The 10 Critiques

### 1. No Customer Logos ❌
**Fix:** Beta program launch
- **Week 1:** Recruit 10 beta customers (paying or pilot)
- **Week 2:** First case study with real ROI numbers
- **Owner:** Dylan (sales + outreach)

### 2. Broken Pricing ✅ (UPDATED — Benioff ARR model)
**Fix:** 4-tier SaaS model, priced on tracked partner ARR
- Launch: $299/mo (up to $1M tracked partner ARR, 10 partners)
- Scale: $799/mo (up to $10M tracked partner ARR, 50 partners) ← Most popular
- Program: $1,999/mo (up to $50M tracked partner ARR, unlimited partners)
- Enterprise: Custom ($50M+ tracked ARR — SSO, SLA, CSM, on-prem)
- Annual billing = 20% discount (default view)
- **Owner:** Fingerz (pricing v2 complete)

### 3. Weak Salesforce Integration ❌
**Fix:** AppExchange native integration
- **Week 2:** Submit AppExchange listing
- **Week 3:** Build managed package (writes to Partner/Opportunity objects)
- **Week 4:** Flow/Apex integration for automation
- **Owner:** Dylan (Salesforce partner signup) + Fingerz (code)

### 4. "Launching March 7" Without Beta ❌
**Fix:** Launch = go-live with paying customers, not "open the doors"
- **Week 1:** 10 beta pilots live
- **Week 2:** Collect feedback, iterate
- **Week 3:** Public launch with testimonials
- **Owner:** Dylan (beta recruitment)

### 5. No ROI Calculator ✅ (IN PROGRESS)
**Fix:** Interactive calculator on homepage
- Input: # partners, hrs/month on reconciliation, avg deal size
- Output: Time saved, cost avoided, revenue lift
- **Owner:** Fingerz (build today)

### 6. Selling Features Not Outcomes ✅ (IN PROGRESS)
**Fix:** Rewrite all copy
- Old: "Attribution models, commission automation"
- New: "Grow partner-sourced revenue 30% in 12 months by investing MDF in the right places"
- **Owner:** Fingerz (rewrite today)

### 7. No Ecosystem Play ❌
**Fix:** Partner program for PartnerBase
- **Week 2:** Recruit 3 implementation partners (consultancies)
- **Week 3:** Build PartnerBase Academy (certification program)
- **Week 4:** Community launch (Slack/Discord for partner ops leaders)
- **Owner:** Dylan (partner recruitment) + Fingerz (academy content)

### 8. Weak Competitive Positioning ✅ (IN PROGRESS)
**Fix:** Own the "Partner Intelligence Platform" category
- **Today:** Battle card (us vs. Impartner/Allbound/Crossbeam)
- **Week 1:** Positioning doc + category definition
- **Week 2:** Thought leadership ("The End of Spreadsheet Partner Ops")
- **Owner:** Fingerz (docs today) + Dylan (distribution)

### 9. Trust Claims Without Proof ✅ (IN PROGRESS)
**Fix:** Trust page with receipts
- SOC 2 roadmap (honest: "in progress, target Q2 2026")
- Data handling policy
- Security whitepaper
- Customer bill of rights
- **Owner:** Fingerz (page today)

### 10. Wrong Buyer (Ops Manager vs CRO) ✅ (IN PROGRESS)
**Fix:** Reposition for C-suite
- Questions we answer:
  - Which partners should we bet on for next year's growth?
  - Where's our next $10M in partner-sourced revenue?
  - Should we cut 20% of our program and reinvest in the top 10%?
- **Owner:** Fingerz (rewrite messaging)

## Immediate Blockers

1. **Beta customers** - Can't build case studies without them (Dylan)
2. **Salesforce partner account** - Needed for AppExchange (Dylan)
3. **SOC 2 audit** - Expensive, needs budget approval (Dylan)

Everything else is execution.
